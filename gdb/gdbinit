define detach_quit
detach
quit

## Set the debugger response to a program call of fork or vfork. A call to fork or vfork creates a new process. The mode argument can be:
##
## parent
## The original process is debugged after a fork. The child process runs unimpeded. This is the default.
##
## child
## The new process is debugged after a fork. The parent process runs unimpeded.

#set follow-fork-mode parent
set follow-fork-mode child
